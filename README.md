# Inter-IIT Prep-Camp

In this repo, I will include all my research work that I will do to upskill my self for Inter-IIT.

1. I have attached the notebook named Lora-Implementation in which I have tried to finetune bloom-1b1 llm model for qa using Lora implementation, it worked fine but with some overfitting resulting in repeated generation of answers.
